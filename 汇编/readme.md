The course "Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective" (CS:APP) on Coursera does indeed cover assembly language. 
The relevant material typically appears in **Chapter 3 and Chapter 4** of the associated textbook. 

These chapters introduce the x86 architecture and provide a detailed look into the instruction set architecture (ISA), data representations, and the basic principles of assembly programming.

In Chapter 3, the focus begins on understanding the data and machine-level representations, which leads into assembly language concepts. 
Chapter 4 continues with more complex assembly programming, including the Y86 architecture, which is a simplified version of x86 used for educational purposes.


These chapters are a great resource if you want to dive into the low-level workings of computer systems, especially from the perspective of how high-level code translates into assembly language and how the CPU executes these instructions【202†source】【203†source】.
